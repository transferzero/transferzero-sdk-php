 * @category    Class
 * @description The state of the recipient. Can be one of the following:  * &#x60;initial&#x60;: We haven&#39;t initiated the payout yet, you can still cancel the transaction * &#x60;pending&#x60;: Payout has been initiated and we&#39;re waiting from a response from the provider. You can try to cancel it at this point, however it will only get cancelled if we get confirmation from our partner that the payment has failed. * &#x60;success&#x60;: Payout is done, and the recipient has been paid. * &#x60;error&#x60;: There was an error from the provider, you can find more details in the &#x60;state_reason&#x60; attribute. We will usually retry the transaction at a later date. You can either wait, edit the recipient or cancel the transaction. * &#x60;refunded&#x60;: You asked us to cancel the transaction and we refunded the money. * &#x60;manual&#x60;: There were too many errors on this transaction, and we stopped retrying. Please edit the recipient, contact us or cancel the transaction. * &#x60;stuck&#x60;: We didn&#39;t receive a response from the provider in time, and we don&#39;t know whether it has been paid our not. Please contact us for further details. * &#x60;overpaid&#x60;: The recipient was paid out more than was requested (not applicable for most of the payout providers) * &#x60;canceled&#x60;: The transaction has been cancelled, and we will refund the money soon * &#x60;exception&#x60;: Some exception has happened; please contact TransferZero
